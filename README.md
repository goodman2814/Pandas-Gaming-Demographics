## Project Description

As part of a project for our bootcamp, we were tasked with generating a report that shows insite to puchasing data from players in the imaginary game 'Heroes of Pymoli'. The data was provided to us containing usernames, items purchased, cost of items, age, gender, etc. We are trying to see what items were purchased with a breakdown by: 
* age and gender 
* most profitble items
* the most popular items
* which users spent the most money on items 

We had to use the pandas library to parse through the data and create tables showing the results of our analysis.
